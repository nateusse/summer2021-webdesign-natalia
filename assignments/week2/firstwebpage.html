                <div class="text-html">
                    <p>I like this book/videos becuase it will help you to undestand HTML and CSS by creating projects. It divied in 5 chapters, 
                    and you cna see how the level of dificulty increases. In chapter one they teach you about the basic structures, In chapter 2 they teach you about the web pages secction such header, main, content and footer.
                    Once you undestand HTML, they will move to CSS. Hoever, my only complain it´s that they teach Bootstrap without spending to much time teaching CSS grids and flex-box.

        <div class="grid-item"><a href="https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.sfpl.org/videos/javascript-dom/9781838559687/">JavaScript DOM - Interactive and Dynamic JavaScript</a>
            <div class="text-js">
                <p>It´s a really short video about how to manipulate the DOM, which for me, it´s something basic.I will Recommended this book
                    to someone that already have some basic  knowleddge in any programming language, and it´s not interested in realerning about arrays, conditionals, and other basic syntax.
                    Intead, this book it´s more for someone who wants to focuse in how JavaScript can be use to manipulated the web page dynamically.
