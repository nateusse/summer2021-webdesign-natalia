        <h1>The art of drawing</h1>
            <p>By Natalia Eusse for my beloved hobby: drawing</p>

        <div class="content">  
            <h2>Why drawing is amazing?</h2>
            <p>I enjoy drawing for a lot of reasons, being the most important: 
                it's an activity that I can do indoors or outside, it relaxes me, 
                I can do while listening 
                podcast, music or an audio-book, 
                I can see and measure my progress, it is artistic, 
                can be cheap and fast or take hours and be a profession, can be done individual or with people,
                can get as complex as you want to,  
                I can keep the result with me or give it to the people I love, 
                and it makes me happy and I can make people happy as well.</p>

                                to 8B pencils like charcoal, you can also find colored pencils, watercolors, sepia,
