 https://mattfarley.ca/
 I liked that is simple, it has his own logo, related with tech, it has an avatar, the color purple, it show the brand that he worked with. I don't like that requires scroll down, no clicks


https://caferati.me/portfolio
I liked that I can see every project and it has links to each web page, it has divisions, comment section,  organized in a way to see back-end and front-end projects. I disliked that I can't control the speed of the interactivities, not clicks no come back.
